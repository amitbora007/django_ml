# Project to learn integrating sklearn models with Django on a House prediction dataset.

Technology used:  
Python
Django
Html/css

First build the ML model and then serialize it. 
I made the model with jupyter and serialized it with pickle "pickle.dump(lm,open(r"lm.pkl","wb"))".
This command will create lm.pkl in same directory as your jupyter notebook. copy this pkl file to django yourApp folder and paste it.
